<p>I am currently a student at Ferris State University. I study Applied Mathematics Computer Science.
I enjoy working on machine learning/artificial intellignece projects. I also like to make small apps for myself that make my life a bit easier.
One such project includes a weather app. It is a work in progress, but so far it gets the job done. </p>
